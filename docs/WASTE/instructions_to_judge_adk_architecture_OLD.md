## Checklist (do these, conceptually)
- **Hard rule:** **read and honor `llms-full.txt`, `AGENTS.md` **. Do **not** modify it. Use the knowledge available in it for improve your judgement.
- **Hard rule:** **read and understand code files in `refs/*` folder **. Do **not** modify it. Use the knowledge of coding patters and best practices available in it to improve your ability to judge multiagent architectures. Do not judge the code files in `refs/*` folder
- **Hard rule:** **read and understand the current architecture of the AI Agents in the file `documentation/google-adk.md`, if present**. **Do **not** modify it.**
- **Hard rule:** **read and understand the current architecture of the AI Agents in the code files in the src folder `src/*`**. 
- **Hard rule:** **The multi agent architecture for your evaluation is solely based on the content of `documentation/google-adk.md`, if present, and code files in the src folder `src/*`, if present,. Do not review any other code files outside of the `src/*` folder, if present,.**
- Understand the system’s control pattern(s) (sequential, router/supervisor, loop, parallel, custom).
- Inspect agent boundaries (specialization, tools, triggers) and shared state/memory.
- Verify tool usage policies, callbacks, and human-in-the-loop gates.
- Assess concurrency safety (parallelism, race-condition mitigations).
- Confirm runtime, session, and resumability configurations.
- Validate guardrails (PII/moderation/jailbreak/hallucination) and output contracts.
- Document findings succinctly for each criterion.

---

## Instructions
- Review the provided architecture against **all criteria** in the table below.
- For each criterion, select **True / False / N/A**:  
  - **True** = the architecture clearly meets the criterion.  
  - **False** = it does not meet the criterion.  
  - **N/A** = the relevant component (agent, tool, router, parallel worker, etc.) does not exist in the design.
- Provide a **1–3 sentence**, concrete explanation in **Additional Note** that ties directly to the architecture.
- If there are **multiple agents/tools**, **repeat the relevant criterion** per agent/tool and provide distinct notes.
- Output **only one file**: `documentation/judge_architecture.md` containing the table described below.

---

## Output Validation
Before finalizing:
- Ensure the table includes **all criteria**, **in order**, with columns:  
  **Criterion No. | Criterion Description | True/False/N/A | Additional Note**
- Confirm every row has a decision or N/A and a brief justification.
- Where information is missing or ambiguous, mark **N/A** and explain **why** in **Additional Note**.

| 53            | Is the critic’s feedback used to trigger revisions or flag issues, rather than being ignored or discarded?                                           |                |                 |
| 54            | Does the workflow include points where a human must approve or provide input before continuing?                                                      |                |                 |
| 55            | Is there a custom tool or callback to send a request to a human and resume once a response is received?                                              |                |                 |

| 57            | Does the system handle delayed or missing human responses gracefully, for example by timing out and continuing with a default?                       |                |                 |
| 58            | Are human-in-the-loop interactions clearly documented, so maintainers know when manual intervention occurs?                                          |                |                 |
