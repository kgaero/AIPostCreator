| Criterion No. | Criterion Description | True/False/N/A | Additional Note |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- | --------------- |
| 1 | Does the architecture achieve the stated goal using the fewest reasonable steps given the requirements? | True | The pipeline uses exactly three dependent stages—outline, research, and composition—to achieve the essay goal with no extra work (documentation/google-adk.md:5-65). |
| 2 | Does the sequence of decomposed sub-tasks fully address all aspects of the original user query, leaving no unresolved gaps? | True | Drafting the outline, gathering sources, and composing the essay collectively cover every requirement stated for the user query (documentation/google-adk.md:5-65). |
| 3 | Is each individual sub-task well-defined and solvable by the assigned agent, which has the necessary tools and context? | True | Each agent's purpose, tools, and session I/O are documented so the assigned sub-task is solvable with the provided context (documentation/google-adk.md:26-36; documentation/google-adk.md:38-53; documentation/google-adk.md:55-65). |
| 4 | Does the plan contain any redundant or overlapping sub-tasks? | True | OutlineGenerator, WebResearcher, and EssayComposer each perform unique work so no redundant phases remain (documentation/google-adk.md:5-65). |
| 5 | Is the sequence of sub-tasks logical, and is the overall agent flow coherent from start to finish? | True | Execution flows logically from outline to research to writing with clear dependent handoffs (documentation/google-adk.md:5-65). |
| 6 | Are the sub-tasks decomposed to an appropriate level of detail, avoiding both ambiguity and excessive overhead? | True | The decomposition stops at the three meaningful phases, avoiding unnecessary micro-steps while keeping roles unambiguous (documentation/google-adk.md:5-65). |
| 7 | Is each sub-task assigned to the most suitable agent based on its specialization? | True | OutlineGenerator handles structure, WebResearcher handles evidence, and EssayComposer handles drafting, so each task sits with the best specialist (documentation/google-adk.md:26-36; documentation/google-adk.md:38-53; documentation/google-adk.md:55-65). |
| 8 | Are the instructions for each sub-task clear, unambiguous, and do they provide all necessary context? | True | Each agent's section lists purpose, inputs, outputs, and special notes, which gives unambiguous instruction (documentation/google-adk.md:26-36; documentation/google-adk.md:38-53; documentation/google-adk.md:55-65). |
| 9 | Does the decomposition correctly identify the right tool and parameters for any sub-task requiring tool use? | True | Only WebResearcher needs external information and it is given specific MCP tools (web_search and url_reader) plus usage guidance (documentation/google-adk.md:38-53). |
| 10 | Does the decomposition correctly identify and manage all dependencies, ensuring tasks are executed in the proper order? | True | Session state keys (topic → outline → sources) capture the dependencies so steps execute in the proper order (documentation/google-adk.md:76-90). |
| 11 | Is all necessary context and data transferred effectively between agents during handoffs, with no loss or misinterpretation? | True | Context moves through explicit session keys (outline, sources, draft_essay) so agents receive exactly the data they need (documentation/google-adk.md:76-90). |
| 12 | Do task handoffs occur at the optimal time in the workflow, without premature or delayed transfers? | True | Handoffs happen after each major phase completes, aligning with when downstream agents actually need the data (documentation/google-adk.md:5-65). |
| 13 | Does the decomposition effectively utilize opportunities for parallelism by running independent sub-tasks concurrently? | N/A | EssayWriterPipeline is defined solely as a SequentialAgent chaining OutlineGenerator, WebResearcher, and EssayComposer, so there are no independent sub-tasks that could run concurrently (documentation/google-adk.md:5-65). |
| 14 | Does the system have a mechanism (e.g., retries, alternative planning) to handle the failure of an individual agent's sub-task? | False | The architecture spec never covers retries, alternate plans, or other failure-handling mechanisms, leaving this criterion unmet (documentation/google-adk.md:5-101). |

| 21 | Does the quality of task decomposition remain high and efficient as query complexity or the number of agents increases? | False | The architecture spec never covers how decomposition quality will scale as topics or agent counts grow, leaving this criterion unmet (documentation/google-adk.md:5-101). |
| 22 | Does the architecture break the user’s goal into smaller sub-tasks, assigning each sub-task to its own agent? | True | The goal is broken into outline, research, and composition sub-tasks, each mapped to a dedicated agent (documentation/google-adk.md:5-65). |
| 23 | Do higher-level (parent) agents delegate work to lower-level sub-agents rather than performing all logic themselves? | True | EssayWriterPipeline delegates execution to its listed sub-agents instead of doing the work itself (documentation/google-adk.md:5-65). |
| 24 | Is the problem decomposed into a multi-level tree, where results are passed back up the hierarchy to the orchestrator? | True | Outputs flow back up through the SequentialAgent so the orchestrator can emit the final essay (documentation/google-adk.md:5-65). |
| 25 | Are unrelated responsibilities separated into different agents, avoiding “god-agents” that handle everything? | True | Outline, research, and writing responsibilities stay in separate agents rather than a single god-agent (documentation/google-adk.md:5-65). |
| 26 | Does the design rely on multiple specialized agents instead of a single monolithic agent for all tasks? | True | The design intentionally relies on multiple specialized LlmAgents instead of a monolith (documentation/google-adk.md:5-65). |
| 27 | Does each agent focus on one domain or function, rather than trying to perform many unrelated tasks? | True | Each agent sticks to a single domain—structure, evidence gathering, or prose drafting—preventing scope creep (documentation/google-adk.md:26-36; documentation/google-adk.md:38-53; documentation/google-adk.md:55-65). |
| 28 | Does the architecture avoid instruction overload by delegating tasks to different specialists, instead of passing all instructions to one agent? | True | Delegation keeps prompts concise for each specialist instead of overloading one instruction block (documentation/google-adk.md:5-65). |
| 29 | Does every agent have a descriptive name and description that clearly states its role and purpose? | True | Every agent is named and described explicitly, clarifying its role (documentation/google-adk.md:26-36; documentation/google-adk.md:38-53; documentation/google-adk.md:55-65). |
| 30 | Are the descriptions specific and distinct enough for an LLM-based router to select the correct agent? | True | Descriptions differentiate the agents clearly enough for any router or developer to pick the right one (documentation/google-adk.md:26-36; documentation/google-adk.md:38-53; documentation/google-adk.md:55-65). |
| 31 | Do each agent’s instruction fields specify how the agent should behave and use its tools, including constraints or limits? | True | Purpose and special-note sections spell out how each agent should behave and any constraints (documentation/google-adk.md:26-36; documentation/google-adk.md:38-53; documentation/google-adk.md:55-65). |
| 32 | Are restrictions for tasks an agent must not handle documented (e.g., by adding negative examples or explicit exclusions)? | False | The architecture spec never covers negative instructions or restrictions about tasks each agent must refuse, leaving this criterion unmet (documentation/google-adk.md:5-101). |
| 33 | Is there a top-level orchestrator/manager agent that coordinates sub-agents? | True | EssayWriterPipeline is explicitly called out as the top-level orchestrator (documentation/google-adk.md:5-65). |
| 34 | Does the code establish parent-child relationships via sub_agents or a similar mechanism, forming a hierarchy? | True | The orchestrator lists sub_agents = [OutlineGenerator, WebResearcher, EssayComposer], forming a hierarchy (documentation/google-adk.md:5-65). |
| 35 | Does the orchestrator delegate tasks based on the sub-agents’ descriptions (either via LLM-driven delegation or explicit tool calls)? | True | Delegation happens by invoking each specialist in order instead of inlining the logic (documentation/google-adk.md:5-65). |
| 36 | Are results from sub-agents returned to the orchestrator and combined to form the final answer? | True | Each sub-agent writes to state so the orchestrator can compile the final essay output (documentation/google-adk.md:5-65). |
| 37 | Does the orchestrator maintain the session context (e.g., shared state) across all interactions? | True | EssayWriterPipeline owns the shared session keys topic, outline, sources, and draft_essay (documentation/google-adk.md:76-90). |
| 38 | Are multi-step tasks implemented with a SequentialAgent or equivalent pipeline, enforcing a fixed execution order? | True | Multi-step execution is anchored by a SequentialAgent, guaranteeing the fixed order Outline → Research → Compose (documentation/google-adk.md:5-65). |
| 39 | Does each step save its output via an output_key in session state, which the next step reads? | True | Each agent declares which key it writes so downstream agents can read it without ambiguity (documentation/google-adk.md:76-90). |
| 40 | Does the code avoid using global variables or ad-hoc channels to pass data between pipeline steps? | True | Shared state replaces globals, so data exchange is structured through the documented keys (documentation/google-adk.md:76-90). |
| 41 | Are sequential workflows used only when each step truly depends on the previous one, rather than forcing sequential execution for independent tasks? | True | Sequential execution is justified because each stage depends entirely on the previous output (documentation/google-adk.md:5-65). |
| 42 | Does the architecture use a ParallelAgent (or concurrency) to run independent tasks simultaneously? | N/A | EssayWriterPipeline is defined solely as a SequentialAgent chaining OutlineGenerator, WebResearcher, and EssayComposer, so no ParallelAgent is declared to execute simultaneous branches (documentation/google-adk.md:5-65). |
| 43 | Do parallel agents write their outputs to distinct keys in shared state to avoid collisions and race conditions? | N/A | EssayWriterPipeline is defined solely as a SequentialAgent chaining OutlineGenerator, WebResearcher, and EssayComposer, so there are no parallel branches that would require distinct output keys (documentation/google-adk.md:5-65). |
| 44 | Is there a subsequent gather/merge step (often a SequentialAgent or aggregator) that reads those keys and combines results? | N/A | EssayWriterPipeline is defined solely as a SequentialAgent chaining OutlineGenerator, WebResearcher, and EssayComposer, so there is no gather or merge step for parallel work because none exists (documentation/google-adk.md:5-65). |
| 45 | Are tasks executed in parallel truly independent, meaning concurrency reduces latency rather than causing contention? | N/A | EssayWriterPipeline is defined solely as a SequentialAgent chaining OutlineGenerator, WebResearcher, and EssayComposer, so no concurrent tasks exist whose independence would need evaluation (documentation/google-adk.md:5-65). |
| 46 | Are loop-based tasks implemented with a LoopAgent or explicit iteration construct rather than unbounded recursion? | N/A | The design only runs the three-step sequential pipeline once, so looping constructs or LoopAgents are never introduced is not applicable (documentation/google-adk.md:5-65). |
| 47 | Is there a clear termination condition (maximum iterations, quality threshold, or a signal from another agent)? | N/A | The design only runs the three-step sequential pipeline once, so no iterative loop exists, so there is no termination condition to specify is not applicable (documentation/google-adk.md:5-65). |
| 48 | Do agents in the loop use shared state to update intermediate results, so that each iteration refines the prior output? | N/A | The design only runs the three-step sequential pipeline once, so without a loop there is no iterative refinement via shared state is not applicable (documentation/google-adk.md:5-65). |
| 49 | Is there a quality-check or control agent that decides when to stop the loop, preventing infinite or unnecessary iterations? | N/A | The design only runs the three-step sequential pipeline once, so there is no loop to monitor, so no quality-check agent decides when to stop is not applicable (documentation/google-adk.md:5-65). |
| 50 | Does the system include a generator agent paired with a critic/reviewer agent to evaluate the generator’s output? | False | The pipeline ends with EssayComposer and no reviewer or critic agent is described, so the generator/critic pattern is absent (documentation/google-adk.md:5-65). |
| 51 | Are the generator and critic executed sequentially, so the critic receives the generator’s output via state? | False | The pipeline ends with EssayComposer and no reviewer or critic agent is described, so the generator/critic pattern is absent (documentation/google-adk.md:5-65). |
| 52 | Does the generator store its output in a state key that the critic reads for review, rather than passing raw text via prompts? | False | The pipeline ends with EssayComposer and no reviewer or critic agent is described, so the generator/critic pattern is absent (documentation/google-adk.md:5-65). |
| 53 | Is the critic’s feedback used to trigger revisions or flag issues, rather than being ignored or discarded? | False | The pipeline ends with EssayComposer and no reviewer or critic agent is described, so the generator/critic pattern is absent (documentation/google-adk.md:5-65). |
| 54 | Does the workflow include points where a human must approve or provide input before continuing? | False | The workflow never introduces a human approval or escalation step; all three agents run autonomously (documentation/google-adk.md:5-65). |
| 55 | Is there a custom tool or callback to send a request to a human and resume once a response is received? | False | The workflow never introduces a human approval or escalation step; all three agents run autonomously (documentation/google-adk.md:5-65). |
| 56 | Are escalation or termination conditions set so that ambiguous or high-impact decisions are handed off to a human? | False | The workflow never introduces a human approval or escalation step; all three agents run autonomously (documentation/google-adk.md:5-65). |
| 57 | Does the system handle delayed or missing human responses gracefully, for example by timing out and continuing with a default? | False | The workflow never introduces a human approval or escalation step; all three agents run autonomously (documentation/google-adk.md:5-65). |
| 58 | Are human-in-the-loop interactions clearly documented, so maintainers know when manual intervention occurs? | False | The workflow never introduces a human approval or escalation step; all three agents run autonomously (documentation/google-adk.md:5-65). |
| 59 | Do agents communicate using ADK’s shared session state, writing and reading keys instead of using global variables? | True | Agents read and write the canonical session keys instead of ad-hoc channels (documentation/google-adk.md:76-90). |
| 60 | Are outputs stored via output_key or explicitly assigned to state keys so that subsequent agents can retrieve them? | True | Outputs are explicitly assigned to keys such as outline, sources, and draft_essay for subsequent retrieval (documentation/google-adk.md:76-90). |
| 61 | In parallel execution, does each agent write to a distinct key to prevent overwriting or race conditions? | N/A | EssayWriterPipeline is defined solely as a SequentialAgent chaining OutlineGenerator, WebResearcher, and EssayComposer, so parallel execution is absent, so no separate keys are needed to prevent collisions (documentation/google-adk.md:5-65). |
| 62 | Is there a clear schema or naming convention for state keys to avoid confusion and collisions? | True | The schema section enumerates each key and its fields, preventing naming collisions (documentation/google-adk.md:76-90). |
| 63 | Are mechanisms (locks, atomic operations, or proper concurrency models) used to handle concurrent access to state, where appropriate? | N/A | EssayWriterPipeline is defined solely as a SequentialAgent chaining OutlineGenerator, WebResearcher, and EssayComposer, so concurrent state access never occurs in this single-threaded pipeline (documentation/google-adk.md:5-65). |
| 64 | Do tools and agents catch exceptions and return structured results with status and error messages instead of crashing? | False | The architecture spec never covers exception handling strategies for agents or tools, leaving this criterion unmet (documentation/google-adk.md:5-101). |

| 66 | Does the workflow check previous outputs for errors and implement fallback logic when necessary (e.g., skipping to a backup agent or default)? | False | The architecture spec never covers fallback logic when a prior step produces unusable output, leaving this criterion unmet (documentation/google-adk.md:5-101). |
| 67 | Is retry logic or alternative execution path implemented for transient failures, such as network errors? | False | The architecture spec never covers retry policies for transient tool or network failures, leaving this criterion unmet (documentation/google-adk.md:5-101). |
| 68 | Are there limits on loop iterations or recursion to avoid infinite loops? | N/A | The design only runs the three-step sequential pipeline once, so no iterative loop is present, so iteration limits are unnecessary is not applicable (documentation/google-adk.md:5-65). |
| 69 | Are errors logged with sufficient context to aid debugging and evaluation? | False | The architecture spec never covers logging guidance for errors or observability, leaving this criterion unmet (documentation/google-adk.md:5-101). |
| 70 | Is each agent implemented as a modular component that can be reused in different workflows? | True | Each agent is treated as a reusable ADK component focused on its own responsibility (documentation/google-adk.md:5-65). |
| 71 | Is the code for each agent kept in its own class or module, allowing independent updates without side effects? | True | The spec implies separate agent modules (one per section) so changes stay localized (documentation/google-adk.md:5-65). |
| 72 | Are common utilities (data models, helper functions, tool wrappers) centralized and reused, rather than duplicated? | N/A | The architecture spec never covers shared utility modules or helper reuse details, leaving this criterion unmet (documentation/google-adk.md:5-101). |
| 73 | Can new agents be added or removed without significant changes to existing ones, due to clear interfaces and separation of concerns? | True | Because responsibilities are separated, additional agents could be inserted or removed with minimal coupling (documentation/google-adk.md:5-65). |
| 74 | Is it straightforward to swap or upgrade an agent’s underlying model or tool without refactoring the entire system? | True | Changing an agent’s model or tools would only touch that agent’s configuration because cross-agent coupling is low (documentation/google-adk.md:5-65). |
| 75 | Are each agent’s prompts/instructions tailored to its specific task, rather than generic across agents? | True | Prompts/instructions are tailored: OutlineGenerator enforces structure, WebResearcher catalogs evidence, and EssayComposer controls prose style (documentation/google-adk.md:26-36; documentation/google-adk.md:38-53; documentation/google-adk.md:55-65). |

| 87 | Does each session maintain isolated state, preventing interference between user sessions? | True | Each session’s state keys are scoped per session, so data from one request does not leak to another (documentation/google-adk.md:76-90). |
| 88 | Is state externalized (e.g., database or stateful service) where long-running or distributed workflows require persistence? | False | The architecture spec never covers externalized persistence for long-running or distributed sessions, leaving this criterion unmet (documentation/google-adk.md:5-101). |
| 89 | Is it possible to add new agents or functions without redeploying the entire system, thanks to modular design? | True | The update protocol emphasizes keeping agents isolated so they can be swapped or extended without broad rewrites (documentation/google-adk.md:5-101). |
| 90 | Does the architecture avoid single points of failure or global variables, allowing multiple instances to run concurrently? | False | The architecture spec never covers redundancy or safeguards against the single orchestrator acting as a point of failure, leaving this criterion unmet (documentation/google-adk.md:5-101). |

| 101 | Does the orchestrator catch exceptions and return a user-friendly message, rather than exposing raw stack traces? | False | The architecture spec never covers exception handling at the orchestrator level, leaving this criterion unmet (documentation/google-adk.md:5-101). |
| 102 | Are there strategies for dealing with unavailable external services, such as serving cached data, delaying tasks, or informing the user gracefully? | False | The architecture spec never covers procedures for unavailable external services beyond waiting, leaving this criterion unmet (documentation/google-adk.md:5-101). |
| 103 | Would adding more steps (finer decomposition) make the architecture simpler to understand or operate overall? | False | The three-phase breakdown is already minimal, so adding finer steps would increase overhead without clarity gains (documentation/google-adk.md:5-65). |
| 104 | Does the current task decomposition directly match a recognized multi-agent design pattern without additional changes? | True | This is a textbook sequential pipeline pattern documented directly in ADK guidance (documentation/google-adk.md:5-65). |
| 105 | Is each agent scoped to a single, clearly defined specialization? | True | OutlineGenerator, WebResearcher, and EssayComposer each have narrow, explicit scopes (documentation/google-adk.md:26-36; documentation/google-adk.md:38-53; documentation/google-adk.md:55-65). |
| 106 | Does each agent have all—and only—the tools necessary to complete its assigned task? | True | Only WebResearcher carries MCP tools, while the other agents correctly remain tool-free (documentation/google-adk.md:38-53). |
| 107 | Would adding a reflection/critique loop likely improve the quality or reliability of outputs for this use case? | True | The architecture spec never covers a critique loop, and adding one could help verify citations and prose quality, leaving this criterion unmet (documentation/google-adk.md:5-101). |
| 108 | Do any parallel agents pose a risk of race conditions or unsafe shared-state access as currently designed? | N/A | EssayWriterPipeline is defined solely as a SequentialAgent chaining OutlineGenerator, WebResearcher, and EssayComposer, so without any parallel agents there is no race-condition risk to evaluate (documentation/google-adk.md:5-65). |
| 109 | Would introducing a human-in-the-loop checkpoint improve risk control sufficiently to justify the added latency? | True | The architecture spec never covers human review, and manual citation or safety checks would meaningfully reduce risk for published essays, leaving this criterion unmet (documentation/google-adk.md:5-101). |
| 110 | If a routing agent exists, are there explicit, testable conditions for when each sub-agent is invoked? | N/A | EssayWriterPipeline is defined solely as a SequentialAgent chaining OutlineGenerator, WebResearcher, and EssayComposer, so no routing agent exists, so conditional routing logic is irrelevant (documentation/google-adk.md:5-65). |
| 111 | For each agent, are there explicit, testable conditions for when each tool is invoked? | True | Usage guidance explains that web_search drives outline-informed queries while url_reader ingests pages (documentation/google-adk.md:38-53). |
| 112 | Do the configured tools provide skills that are directly relevant and sufficient for their owning agent’s objectives? | True | The MCP tools directly support WebResearcher’s evidence-gathering mission (documentation/google-adk.md:38-53). |
| 113 | Does the task require multiple specialties rather than a single specialty to finish? | True | The task spans outlining, researching, and writing, so multiple specialties are necessary (documentation/google-adk.md:5-65). |
| 114 | Is a single agent sufficient to achieve the desired output? | False | The spec explicitly opts for multiple agents because a single agent would have to juggle disparate skills (documentation/google-adk.md:5-65). |
| 115 | Is the system intentionally designed as multi-agent (rather than single-agent)? | True | The document frames the solution as a multi-agent pipeline, not a monolithic assistant (documentation/google-adk.md:5-65). |

| 125 | Is the agent’s work intended to be deterministic (same input → same output)? | False | Each agent relies on Gemini outputs, so responses can vary and determinism is not promised (documentation/google-adk.md:5-65). |
| 126 | Is the agent’s work expected to be probabilistic (may vary run to run)? | True | Gemini-powered creative writing is inherently probabilistic, so variability is expected (documentation/google-adk.md:5-65). |

| 131 | For a **Loop Agent**, is the per-iteration order defined? | N/A | The design only runs the three-step sequential pipeline once, so no LoopAgent means there is no per-iteration order to describe is not applicable (documentation/google-adk.md:5-65). |
| 132 | For a **Loop Agent**, are inputs/outputs defined for each sub-agent? | N/A | The design only runs the three-step sequential pipeline once, so loop-free design means no per-iteration inputs/outputs are defined is not applicable (documentation/google-adk.md:5-65). |
| 133 | For a **Loop Agent**, is a maximum number of iterations set? | N/A | The design only runs the three-step sequential pipeline once, so without a loop there is no iteration cap to set is not applicable (documentation/google-adk.md:5-65). |
| 134 | For a **Loop Agent**, is a clear termination condition defined? | N/A | The design only runs the three-step sequential pipeline once, so no loop exists, so no termination condition is provided is not applicable (documentation/google-adk.md:5-65). |
| 135 | For a **Loop Agent**, are the sub-agents that can signal STOP identified? | N/A | The design only runs the three-step sequential pipeline once, so no agent can signal STOP for a loop that does not exist is not applicable (documentation/google-adk.md:5-65). |
| 136 | For a **Parallel Agent**, are parallel sub-agents listed? | N/A | EssayWriterPipeline is defined solely as a SequentialAgent chaining OutlineGenerator, WebResearcher, and EssayComposer, so no ParallelAgent is part of this pipeline (documentation/google-adk.md:5-65). |
