# Multi-Agent Architecture Assessment

## Topic - Objective & Scope Fit
Finding 1: EssayWriterPipeline, OutlineGenerator, WebResearcher, and EssayComposer exist only in documentation/google-adk.md:5-65 while the repository lacks a `agents/` directory, so no ADK code actually fulfills the stated 3-step workflow scope.
Finding 2: The specification never defines measurable success criteria or connects to eval/test artifacts—its Update Protocol at documentation/google-adk.md:93-99 only asks for name/parity checks—so objectives cannot be validated against outputs.

## Topic - Task Decomposition Quality
Finding 1: WebResearcher is tasked with searching, extracting, deduplicating, citation normalizing, and reliability scoring in one agent (documentation/google-adk.md:38-53), indicating an over-broad sub-task rather than minimal coherent steps.
Finding 2: The pipeline jumps directly from research to EssayComposer (documentation/google-adk.md:55-65) with no decomposed QA, fact-check, or citation-audit stage, leaving a major user journey gap.

## Topic - Specialized vs. Monolithic Design
Finding 1: EssayWriterPipeline is merely a SequentialAgent with no tools, callbacks, or routing logic (documentation/google-adk.md:14-23), so the orchestrator acts as a thin pass-through instead of a specialized coordinator enforcing policy.
Finding 2: EssayComposer handles style, length control, citation weaving, and bibliography generation simultaneously (documentation/google-adk.md:55-65), signaling monolithic responsibilities rather than small focused specialists.

## Topic - Agent Role Clarity (name/description/instruction)
Finding 1: Each agent entry lists a “Purpose” but no actual `instruction` string or prompt content (documentation/google-adk.md:14-65), making behavior boundaries ambiguous to ADK.
Finding 2: None of the agents declares negative scope, tool usage rules, or escalation guidance, so routing decisions are underspecified despite the requirement for precise instructions.

## Topic - Tooling Fit per Agent (principle of least privilege)
Finding 1: WebResearcher attaches `web_search` and `url_reader` (documentation/google-adk.md:44-53) without documenting query caps, allowed domains, or parameter validation, violating least-privilege expectations.
Finding 2: The referenced MCP tools have no companion definitions anywhere in the repo, so secrets, auth, and safety constraints for these capabilities are undefined.

## Topic - Hierarchical Orchestration (parent/child, routing, delegation)
Finding 1: The SequentialAgent↔sub-agent relationships are described only in documentation/google-adk.md:5-23; without any implementing modules, the hierarchy is theoretical and cannot be executed or tested.
Finding 2: There is no mention of how the parent validates child outputs or aggregates state before advancing, so delegation hygiene (handoffs, completion checks) is unspecified.

## Topic - Workflow Patterns Coverage — Sequential pipelines
Finding 1: Although the flow is sequential, there are no guards ensuring OutlineGenerator writes a usable `outline` before WebResearcher runs (documentation/google-adk.md:28-52), so state chaining is fragile.
Finding 2: The spec never defines verification before EssayComposer uses `sources` (documentation/google-adk.md:55-65), so the sequential pipeline lacks validation checkpoints between steps.

## Topic - Workflow Patterns Coverage — Parallel fan-out/gather
Finding 1: Research tasks per outline heading are independent, yet the architecture assigns everything to a single WebResearcher agent (documentation/google-adk.md:38-53), missing any parallel fan-out to reduce latency.
Finding 2: With no parallelism, there is also no gather/merge stage to reconcile multi-branch outputs, so this workflow pattern is entirely absent.

## Topic - Workflow Patterns Coverage — Iterative refinement/loops (termination, max iters)
Finding 1: No LoopAgent or iterative construct exists; each agent runs once (documentation/google-adk.md:5-65), so there is no mechanism to refine outlines, research, or drafts when quality is inadequate.
Finding 2: The only policy note says max_iterations are “inherited” (documentation/google-adk.md:22) but provides no counts or stop conditions, leaving loops undefined.

## Topic - Workflow Patterns Coverage — Generator–Critic (review/fact-check)
Finding 1: The architecture lacks any reviewer/critic agent to fact-check `draft_essay` against `sources`, so generator output is never gated (documentation/google-adk.md:55-90).
Finding 2: Without reviewer state keys or pass/fail criteria, there is no trigger to request repairs or reruns, so hallucinations can ship unchallenged.

## Topic - Workflow Patterns Coverage — Human-in-the-loop checkpoints
Finding 1: The documentation enumerates only automated agents (documentation/google-adk.md:5-90); no human approval or confirmation checkpoints are defined before publishing content.
Finding 2: There is no resume logic or timeout handling for potential human input, so recovery after manual inspection is impossible.

## Topic - Shared State & Data Passing (state keys, schemas, immutability/overwrites, provenance)
Finding 1: Session keys are described informally (documentation/google-adk.md:76-90) with no ownership or immutability rules, so multiple agents could overwrite values without governance.
Finding 2: The `sources` structure is explained in prose but lacks schema enforcement or provenance tracking, risking inconsistent payloads when passed to EssayComposer.

## Topic - Inter-Agent Communication (A2A/delegation calls, message structure, handoff completeness)
Finding 1: Beyond naming shared keys (documentation/google-adk.md:76-90), there is no defined message contract or serialization format for how `outline` or `sources` are handed between agents.
Finding 2: Handoffs omit identifiers (conversation ID, request ID), so retries or idempotent replays cannot faithfully reconstruct context.

## Topic - Prompt & Policy Design (agent-specific prompts, tuning/refinement, tool docs, format contracts, few-shot)
Finding 1: No prompt text, few-shot examples, or tool instructions are captured anywhere—each agent only lists intentions (documentation/google-adk.md:26-65), leaving policy alignment unspecified.
Finding 2: Safety/policy constraints for web content (copyright, PII) or citation style are never embedded in the prompts, so the LLM has no guardrails to follow.

## Topic - Determinism & Idempotency (idempotent tools, replay safety, duplicate suppression)
Finding 1: The architecture provides no idempotency keys or dedup caches for repeated `web_search`/`url_reader` calls (documentation/google-adk.md:44-53), so retries can trigger duplicate external actions.
Finding 2: There is no deterministic merge of `sources`—the YAML snippet (documentation/google-adk.md:78-90) lacks ordering rules, so outputs vary per run.

## Topic - Error Handling & Robustness (try/except, typed error results, retries/backoff, circuit breakers, timeouts)
Finding 1: None of the agents documents try/except handling, retries, or timeouts; failures in `web_search` would surface as model errors with no containment (documentation/google-adk.md:38-53).
Finding 2: There are no typed error payloads or circuit breakers described anywhere, so cascading failures cannot be detected or short-circuited.

## Topic - Graceful Degradation & Fallbacks (partial results, alternate paths, user notification)
Finding 1: The pipeline has no fallback model or alternate agent when WebResearcher fails, so the entire flow collapses instead of returning partial research (documentation/google-adk.md:38-53).
Finding 2: User messaging for degraded outputs is never defined, leaving consumers unaware of missing sections or citations.

## Topic - Observability & Tracing (structured logs, event traces, tool call audits, correlation IDs)
Finding 1: Except for naming `before_tool_callback`/`after_tool_callback` (documentation/google-adk.md:48-52), there is no logging schema, destination, or correlation ID plan, so observability is effectively absent.
Finding 2: No metrics (latency, tool counts, token usage) are captured or surfaced despite being critical for monitoring essay generation.

## Topic - Evaluation Hooks & Testability (ADK eval cases, trajectory checks, rubric/LLM judges, regression tests/pytest)
Finding 1: The repo has no tests or eval suites for the essay pipeline—only documentation and requirements exist—so objectives cannot be regressed.
Finding 2: There are no ADK eval configs, rubric judges, or trajectory checks mentioned in documentation/google-adk.md:93-99, leaving quality unmeasured.

## Topic - Performance Engineering (concurrency via ParallelAgent/async, batching, caching, n+1 avoidance)
Finding 1: With a single WebResearcher and strictly sequential flow (documentation/google-adk.md:5-53), the design cannot exploit concurrency or batching for research.
Finding 2: No caching/memoization of sources or outlines is specified, so repeated topics will always re-do expensive work.

## Topic - Cost Controls (token budgets, call caps, caching, early-exit heuristics)
Finding 1: Aside from “max_iterations inherited” (documentation/google-adk.md:22), there are no token budgets, call caps, or early exit heuristics, so costs are uncontrolled.
Finding 2: The tool list lacks per-call limits for `web_search` / `url_reader`, risking runaway external queries.

## Topic - Scalability & Deployment (stateless sessions, externalized memory, containerization, autoscaling)
Finding 1: Without any `agents/` implementation or deployment scripts, there is no agent module exporting `root_agent`, so the system cannot be packaged or deployed.
Finding 2: The design never addresses statelessness, external memory services, or autoscaling triggers, so it is not production-ready.

## Topic - Configuration & Versioning (RunConfig/ResumabilityConfig, model/param pinning, prompt/version control)
Finding 1: No RunConfig, ResumabilityConfig, or model parameter pinning is described; each agent merely states a preferred model (documentation/google-adk.md:28-65), so runs are not reproducible.
Finding 2: The Update Protocol (documentation/google-adk.md:93-99) suggests versioning prompts but provides no mechanism or files to track revisions.

## Topic - Security & Access Control (secrets management, least privilege, sandboxed execution, authN/authZ)
Finding 1: There is no mention of how MCP tool credentials or API keys are stored; the repo lacks `.env` guidance specific to this agent, so secrets risk exposure.
Finding 2: `web_search`/`url_reader` can hit arbitrary URLs without domain allowlists or sandboxing (documentation/google-adk.md:44-47), so the system does not enforce least privilege.

## Topic - Safety & Compliance (content filters, hallucination checks, PII handling, audit trails)
Finding 1: The EssayComposer prompt plan (documentation/google-adk.md:55-65) omits hallucination or source-consistency checks, so unsafe content could pass through.
Finding 2: No PII handling, audit trail, or policy filters are articulated anywhere, so compliance posture is undefined.

## Topic - Data Contracts & Schemas (typed inputs/outputs, strict JSON, schema evolution)
Finding 1: Session keys are informal YAML (documentation/google-adk.md:76-90) instead of typed Pydantic/dataclass schemas, so agents have no enforceable contracts.
Finding 2: There is no schema versioning or migration story, making backward compatibility unmanageable.

## Topic - Dependencies & Tool Quality (library pinning, retries, rate limits, backoff, resilience patterns)
Finding 1: requirements.txt pins general libraries (requirements.txt:1-8) but does not declare MCP/web tooling dependencies the architecture relies upon, so runtime imports will fail.
Finding 2: The tool descriptions (documentation/google-adk.md:44-53) never specify retries, backoff, or rate-limit handling, so resilience is lacking.

## Topic - Resource & Rate Management (quotas, pooling, exponential backoff, jitter)
Finding 1: No quota or backoff strategy is stated for repeated web searches (documentation/google-adk.md:44-47), so the system could exceed provider limits.
Finding 2: There is no connection/thread pooling or queueing design, so resource usage cannot be smoothed under load.

## Topic - UX & Product Integration (streaming behavior, user prompts for ambiguity, interruption/undo)
Finding 1: The documentation never mentions a user interface, streaming strategies, or clarifying questions, so UX integration is undefined.
Finding 2: There are no provisions for pause/undo or confirmation before citing risky sources, limiting safe product behavior.

## Topic - Documentation & Runbooks (agent inventories, sequence diagrams, failure playbooks, SLOs)
Finding 1: Apart from the single architecture spec, there are no runbooks, SLOs, or sequence diagrams describing operations or failure response.
Finding 2: No failure playbooks or change-management notes exist, so on-call engineers would have no guidance.

## Topic - Readiness Gates (pre-prod checks, canary runs, kill-switches, rollback plans)
Finding 1: The architecture omits pre-production evaluation bars, canary plans, or sign-off steps, so nothing prevents regressions from shipping.
Finding 2: Kill-switches, feature flags, and rollback/incident plans are absent, leaving no guardrails for risky deployments.
