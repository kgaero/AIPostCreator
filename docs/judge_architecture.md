# Multi-Agent Architecture Assessment

## Topic - Objective & Scope Fit
Finding 1: `docs/google-adk.md:5-62` documents the `ai_news_pipeline` sequential flow exactly as wired in `agents/ai_news/agent.py:11-22`, so declared objectives align with the implemented scope.
Finding 2: Neither the documentation nor the code defines measurable success criteria or evaluation hooks—`docs/google-adk.md:84-89` only prescribes documentation hygiene, and `tests/test_ai_news_agent.py:64-90` limits validation to structural assertions.

## Topic - Task Decomposition Quality
Finding 1: The workflow decomposes into alignment, research, and writing only (`docs/google-adk.md:5-62`), leaving no dedicated fact-check or QA stage before publication.
Finding 2: The sequential root in `agents/ai_news/agent.py:11-22` sets no callbacks or guards, so each handoff assumes prior steps succeeded without validation.

## Topic - Specialized vs. Monolithic Design
Finding 1: Each sub-agent handles a single focused task with bespoke prompts (`agents/ai_news/sub_agents/topic_alignment.py:10-19`, `agents/ai_news/sub_agents/news_researcher.py:11-21`, `agents/ai_news/sub_agents/news_writer.py:10-19`).
Finding 2: The root orchestrator lacks an instruction or policy enforcement layer (`agents/ai_news/agent.py:11-22`), so coordination responsibilities remain implicit.

## Topic - Agent Role Clarity (name/description/instruction)
Finding 1: Sub-agent names, descriptions, and prompts clearly reflect their duties (`agents/ai_news/sub_agents/topic_alignment.py:10-19`, `agents/ai_news/sub_agents/news_researcher.py:11-21`, `agents/ai_news/sub_agents/news_writer.py:10-19`; `agents/ai_news/prompt.py:11-65`).
Finding 2: The SequentialAgent root exposes only a description without an instruction (`agents/ai_news/agent.py:11-22`), creating ambiguity about its decision boundaries.

## Topic - Tooling Fit per Agent (principle of least privilege)
Finding 1: Only the research stage attaches `google_search`, matching the documented tool distribution (`docs/google-adk.md:42-50`; `agents/ai_news/sub_agents/news_researcher.py:11-21`).
Finding 2: There is no configuration for rate limiting or safe-search constraints around `google_search` (`agents/ai_news/sub_agents/news_researcher.py:11-21`), leaving least-privilege safeguards unspecified.

## Topic - Hierarchical Orchestration (parent/child, routing, delegation)
Finding 1: The parent explicitly orders sub-agents (`agents/ai_news/agent.py:11-21`), delivering a predictable delegation chain.
Finding 2: No callbacks or completion checks confirm child outputs before progression (`agents/ai_news/agent.py:11-22`), so orchestration assumes success without verification.

## Topic - Workflow Patterns Coverage — Sequential pipelines
Finding 1: The system implements a straight sequential pipeline as described in `docs/google-adk.md:5-70`.
Finding 2: Absence of preconditions or state validation between stages (`agents/ai_news/agent.py:11-22`) makes the pipeline brittle when intermediate outputs are incomplete.

## Topic - Workflow Patterns Coverage — Parallel fan-out/gather
Finding 1: There is no ParallelAgent or parallel fan-out—the hierarchy lists only a single researcher (`docs/google-adk.md:5-62`).
Finding 2: Without fan-out, no gather or merge logic exists for multi-threaded research results (`agents/ai_news/agent.py:11-22`).

## Topic - Workflow Patterns Coverage — Iterative refinement/loops (termination, max iters)
Finding 1: The architecture lacks LoopAgents or retry logic; only one pass is configured (`docs/google-adk.md:5-62`; `agents/ai_news/agent.py:11-22`).
Finding 2: There are no explicit iteration ceilings or stop conditions beyond the note that limits are “inherited” (`docs/google-adk.md:24-24`).

## Topic - Workflow Patterns Coverage — Generator–Critic (review/fact-check)
Finding 1: No critic or evaluator agent reviews `ai_news_post` before completion (`docs/google-adk.md:5-62`).
Finding 2: Without a fact-check stage, hallucination or citation errors in writing go unchecked (`agents/ai_news/sub_agents/news_writer.py:10-19`).

## Topic - Workflow Patterns Coverage — Human-in-the-loop checkpoints
Finding 1: The documentation enumerates only automated agents with no human approval stages (`docs/google-adk.md:5-89`).
Finding 2: Prompts lack instructions for pausing or soliciting human clarification (`agents/ai_news/prompt.py:11-65`), so the flow cannot incorporate manual review.

## Topic - Shared State & Data Passing (state keys, schemas, immutability/overwrites, provenance)
Finding 1: Each LlmAgent writes to a specific `output_key`, defining canonical artifacts (`agents/ai_news/sub_agents/topic_alignment.py:10-19`, `agents/ai_news/sub_agents/news_researcher.py:11-21`, `agents/ai_news/sub_agents/news_writer.py:10-19`).
Finding 2: Documentation claims that downstream agents read `[]` (`docs/google-adk.md:36-61`), leaving consumption of prior state implicit and risking missing inputs if defaults change.

## Topic - Inter-Agent Communication (A2A/delegation calls, message structure, handoff completeness)
Finding 1: Handoffs rely on SequentialAgent defaults without explicit message schemas (`agents/ai_news/agent.py:11-22`).
Finding 2: No A2A or AgentTool wrappers communicate structured payloads, so inter-agent messaging lacks schema guarantees (`docs/google-adk.md:42-60`).

## Topic - Prompt & Policy Design (agent-specific prompts, tuning/refinement, tool docs, format contracts, few-shot)
Finding 1: Prompts define clear tasks and output formats for each agent (`agents/ai_news/prompt.py:11-65`).
Finding 2: There are no few-shot examples or safeguards against off-policy behavior, particularly for citation formatting (`agents/ai_news/prompt.py:50-65`).

## Topic - Determinism & Idempotency (idempotent tools, replay safety, duplicate suppression)
Finding 1: The architecture provides no deterministic settings or replay safeguards; neither doc nor code sets reproducibility controls (`docs/google-adk.md:24-24`; `agents/ai_news/agent.py:11-22`).
Finding 2: Research depends on live search with no deduplication guardrails, inviting inconsistent results across runs (`agents/ai_news/sub_agents/news_researcher.py:11-21`).

## Topic - Error Handling & Robustness (try/except, typed error results, retries/backoff, circuit breakers, timeouts)
Finding 1: Agents are instantiated without error-handling callbacks or retry policies (`agents/ai_news/agent.py:11-22`).
Finding 2: Prompts do not instruct agents to surface partial failures or retry search queries on errors (`agents/ai_news/prompt.py:30-65`).

## Topic - Graceful Degradation & Fallbacks (partial results, alternate paths, user notification)
Finding 1: No fallback agents or alternate flows are defined if search fails (`docs/google-adk.md:5-62`).
Finding 2: The writer prompt assumes complete research notes and gives no guidance for degraded outputs (`agents/ai_news/prompt.py:50-65`).

## Topic - Observability & Tracing (structured logs, event traces, tool call audits, correlation IDs)
Finding 1: Neither code nor docs mention logging, tracing, or audit hooks (`agents/ai_news/agent.py:11-22`; `docs/google-adk.md:84-89`).
Finding 2: Without telemetry, tracking tool usage or prompt drift over time is impossible (`agents/ai_news/sub_agents/news_researcher.py:11-21`).

## Topic - Evaluation Hooks & Testability (ADK eval cases, trajectory checks, rubric/LLM judges, regression tests/pytest)
Finding 1: Basic unit tests verify wiring, tool attachment, and prompt constraints (`tests/test_ai_news_agent.py:64-90`).
Finding 2: No ADK evaluation suites or trajectory-based tests exist to score agent outputs (`docs/google-adk.md:84-89`; `agents/ai_news`).

## Topic - Performance Engineering (concurrency via ParallelAgent/async, batching, caching, n+1 avoidance)
Finding 1: The architecture lacks concurrency primitives or caching layers (`agents/ai_news/agent.py:11-22`).
Finding 2: Research relies on sequential live searches with no batching guidance (`agents/ai_news/prompt.py:30-48`).

## Topic - Cost Controls (token budgets, call caps, caching, early-exit heuristics)
Finding 1: No `RunConfig` or token budgets are configured for any agent (`agents/ai_news/agent.py:11-22`).
Finding 2: Prompts omit early-exit heuristics or cost awareness, risking runaway usage (`agents/ai_news/prompt.py:11-65`).

## Topic - Scalability & Deployment (stateless sessions, externalized memory, containerization, autoscaling)
Finding 1: There is no deployment guidance or stateless session strategy in docs or code (`docs/google-adk.md:84-89`; `agents/ai_news/agent.py:11-22`).
Finding 2: Memory or artifact services are not configured, limiting scalability beyond single-session defaults (`agents/ai_news`).

## Topic - Configuration & Versioning (RunConfig/ResumabilityConfig, model/param pinning, prompt/version control)
Finding 1: Agents rely on hardcoded model strings without `RunConfig` pinning (`agents/ai_news/sub_agents/topic_alignment.py:7-18`, `agents/ai_news/sub_agents/news_researcher.py:8-21`, `agents/ai_news/sub_agents/news_writer.py:7-19`).
Finding 2: Documentation tracks the architecture but not prompt or config versioning (`docs/google-adk.md:84-89`).

## Topic - Security & Access Control (secrets management, least privilege, sandboxed execution, authN/authZ)
Finding 1: There is no mention of securing the Google Search tool credentials or API keys (`agents/ai_news/sub_agents/news_researcher.py:11-21`).
Finding 2: Absence of auth or role-based checks in docs leaves human/operator access undefined (`docs/google-adk.md:84-89`).

## Topic - Safety & Compliance (content filters, hallucination checks, PII handling, audit trails)
Finding 1: The system prompt restricts coverage to AI news (`agents/ai_news/prompt.py:3-9`), providing a high-level safety guard.
Finding 2: No automated hallucination checks or PII scrubbing steps are implemented (`agents/ai_news/prompt.py:30-65`; `docs/google-adk.md:42-60`).

## Topic - Data Contracts & Schemas (typed inputs/outputs, strict JSON, schema evolution)
Finding 1: Outputs are defined via prompt instructions rather than typed schemas (`agents/ai_news/prompt.py:23-65`).
Finding 2: No Pydantic models or schema validations guard the session keys (`agents/ai_news/sub_agents/topic_alignment.py:10-19`; `agents/ai_news/sub_agents/news_researcher.py:11-21`; `agents/ai_news/sub_agents/news_writer.py:10-19`).

## Topic - Dependencies & Tool Quality (library pinning, retries, rate limits, backoff, resilience patterns)
Finding 1: Tool usage depends on bundled ADK utilities without explicit version pinning or retry wrappers (`agents/ai_news/sub_agents/news_researcher.py:11-21`).
Finding 2: Requirements or lockfiles do not document resilience expectations for external APIs (`docs/google-adk.md:84-89`).

## Topic - Resource & Rate Management (quotas, pooling, exponential backoff, jitter)
Finding 1: No rate or quota management policies are defined for web search calls (`agents/ai_news/sub_agents/news_researcher.py:11-21`).
Finding 2: There is no shared resource controller across agents (`agents/ai_news/agent.py:11-22`).

## Topic - UX & Product Integration (streaming behavior, user prompts for ambiguity, interruption/undo)
Finding 1: Neither the prompts nor docs describe user-facing streaming or undo affordances (`agents/ai_news/prompt.py:11-65`; `docs/google-adk.md:84-89`).
Finding 2: The workflow never asks clarifying questions when topics are ambiguous, despite alignment risks (`agents/ai_news/prompt.py:11-28`).

## Topic - Documentation & Runbooks (agent inventories, sequence diagrams, failure playbooks, SLOs)
Finding 1: `docs/google-adk.md:5-89` inventories agents accurately and matches the code.
Finding 2: Runbooks, failure playbooks, or SLOs are absent, leaving operators without response guidance (`docs/google-adk.md:84-89`).

## Topic - Readiness Gates (pre-prod checks, canary runs, kill-switches, rollback plans)
Finding 1: No readiness or canary procedures are documented (`docs/google-adk.md:84-89`).
Finding 2: There are no kill switches or rollback hooks in the agent wiring (`agents/ai_news/agent.py:11-22`).

## Topic - Use of Readymade packages, framework, tools
Finding 1: The design reuses ADK’s `google_search` tool for research instead of bespoke scrapers (`agents/ai_news/sub_agents/news_researcher.py:11-21`).
Finding 2: Opportunities remain to leverage ADK evaluation utilities or AgentTools for quality gates, which are currently absent (`agents/ai_news/agent.py:11-22`; `docs/google-adk.md:84-89`).
